    "transcripFt": "A new sign of aggression coming from President Trump toward Venezuela, along with a new report of a phone call between the president and that country's leader, Nicholas Maduro, late last week, according to The New York Times. We'd warn them stop sending poisons into our country. Any direct contact stands out because the U.S. this week designated Maduro the head of a foreign terrorist organization and led three months of deadly strikes at sea. Bombing vessels, the administration says, transport illegal drugs, more than 80 killed. Now President Trump is ramping up his threat. And we'll be starting to stop him by land also. The land is easier, but that's going to start very soon. This week, Maduro engaged in his own saber rattling. However, theatrical, he also met with his military, pledging to defend every inch of Venezuela. Tuesday, the president told reporters he might talk to Maduro, but did not indicate any call had already happened. We can save lives, we can do things the easy way that's fine, and we have to do it in the heart where that's fine too. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Higgseth visited the U.S. as Gerald Ford in the Caribbean and stopped in the Dominican Republic amid the U.S. buildup. In waging this war on Narco-Terris, we're willing to go on the offense. Go on the offense in a way that changes the dynamic for the entire region. Kelly is traveling with the president in West Palm Beach and is joining us live tonight. And Kelly, any escalation with Venezuela could mean some new criticism for the president from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. We've already seen Democrats and a few Republicans who have questioned the legal justification for the Trump administration's operations in the Caribbean. Congress typically must authorize military action in another country. The administration has defended its operation so far, citing national security to introduce the drug flow. Haley?

    "transcript": "Decision tree organize a series of rules in the tree structure. It is one of the most practical methods for non-parametric supervised learning. Our goal in this video is to demonstrate how to create a decision tree that predict the value of a target by landing decision rules inferred from the training data. Let's first have a look at some important terminology of decision tree. The root node is at the beginning of a tree. It represents the entire population being analyzed. Splitting is the process of dividing a node into sub nodes. When a sub node can be splitted into further nodes, then it is called decision nodes. Leaf nodes are the nodes of a tree that have no further splitted nodes. When we remove sub nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. This is the upside process of splitting, which is used to prevent overfitting. Now let's demonstrate the process of creating a decision tree from data. First of all, let's inspect the data set. In this example, there are two classes and two features, SES and collar for the training data. We can construct some decision rules from the features. For example, here are two simple decision rules. The first is whether the SES is greater or equal to two, and the second is whether the collar is yellow or not. In real application, there are usually a lot of decision rules we can choose from, so we need to find a way to choose the best decision route to split the current node. Starting from the root node, we are going to iterate through all the decision rules and calculate the information gain of the current split. The first is the center piece of this step, so what is the information gain? Let's have a closer look at each group within the decision rule. The group is a pure when all of its records belong to the same class. Here we use Gini impurity to measure how pure the current node aids. When the group is pure, Gini impurity is zero. When the group is half and half mixed, Gini impurity is 0.5. For any decision split, a parent group is split into two child groups. The information gain of this split is the impurity of the parent group, matters weighted average impurity of the child group. Once we calculate the information gain of each split in decision rule, we now can select the decision rule which has the largest information gain to split the current node. Then we can split the child node recursively, and only considering decision rule never selected before in the current branch. We stop splitting if there are no decision rules left of the group impurity is 0. Sometimes pruning and early stop condition are used to prevent a large number of splits and overfeeding. Now, the decision tree can predict the probability of each class at the ratio of each class in the node. In this case, for the record which says greater or equal to 2 and color is yellow, there is a 50% chance the class record is a circle. So that is a brief demonstration of how to construct decision tree from data. It has a lot of advantages like is it to interpret and straightforward for visualizations? However, it has a big disadvantage. Single decision tree model are prone to overfeeding, especially when a tree is particularly deep. One way to combat this issue is by setting a max depth of the tree. This will limit the risk of overfeeding, but this will be at the expense of increasing barriers. Random forest is a good way to prevent overfeeding with all to sacrifice in buyers. It is simply a collection of decision trees whose results are aggregated into one final result. It is a strong ensemble modeling technique and much more robust than a single decision tree. So in reward application, people usually go directly into using random forest for modeling.
